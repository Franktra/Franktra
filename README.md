👋 Hi, I’m @Franktra!

🧠👀 My background in Speech-Language Pathology has been a catalyst for my foray into the captivating realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Prompt Engineering (PE). Through years of engagement with marginalized populations, I’ve developed an unwavering commitment to creating AI tools that are innovative, accessible, unbiased, and equitable. My focus is now channeling this dedication into AI to effect positive societal change. 🌍💪🏾

🌱 I am actively delving into NLP methodologies and sharpening my skills in prompt engineering. Concurrently, I am investigating pedagogically innovative approaches to empower individuals in leveraging large language models effectively across diverse applications. 📚💡

🌟 Recently, at the Lesbians Who Tech & Allies Conference in October 2023, I had the privilege of presenting "Prompt Engineering: Leveraging Learning and Development with AI and Prompt Engineering." This session, which I designed, explored the intersection of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing. There, I introduced the Action Framework, a methodology I developed, to enhance business, professional, and personal growth through AI applications. I also discussed AI’s benefits in education and customer service, its potential risks, and the importance of ethical considerations.

💞️ I am interested in collaborating on AI and NLP projects that have the potential to make a meaningful impact on communities and organizations. My passion encompasses guiding stakeholders in utilizing language models efficiently and fostering a data-driven culture anchored in equity and fairness. Let's join forces and create something amazing together! 🤝🌟

🔗 Transitioning from Speech-Language Pathology to AI has been an enlightening and rewarding journey. In this realm, my expertise in language can make a substantial contribution to technological innovation and help address biases in AI, ensuring that models are representative and equitable. Constitutional AI and responsible practices are central to my endeavors, as I aspire to usher in AI that serves all segments of society. 🌐🤖
