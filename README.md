👋 Hi, I’m @Franktra,


🧠👀 My background in Speech-Language Pathology has been a catalyst for my foray into the captivating realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Prompt Engineering (PE). Through years of engagement with marginalized populations, I’ve developed an unwavering commitment to creating AI tools that are innovative, accessible, unbiased, and equitable. My focus is now channeling this dedication into AI to effect positive societal change.

🌱 I am actively delving into NLP methodologies and sharpening my skills in prompt engineering. Concurrently, I am investigating pedagogically innovative approaches to empower individuals in leveraging large language models effectively across diverse applications.

💞️ I am keen to collaborate on AI and NLP projects that have the potential to make a meaningful impact on communities and organizations. My passion encompasses guiding stakeholders in utilizing language models efficiently and fostering a data-driven culture anchored in equity and fairness.

🔗 Transitioning from Speech-Language Pathology to AI has been an enlightening and rewarding journey. In this realm, my expertise in language can make a substantial contribution to technological innovation and help address biases in AI, ensuring that models are representative and equitable. Constitutional AI and responsible practices are central to my endeavors, as I aspire to usher in AI that serves all segments of society.
